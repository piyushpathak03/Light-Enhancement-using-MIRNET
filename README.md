# Low Light Image Enhancement using Python & Deep Learning

## MIRNET
Framework of the proposed network MIRNet that learns enriched feature representations for image restoration and enhancement. MIRNet is based on a recursive
residual design. In the core of MIRNet is the multi-scale residual block (MRB) whose
main branch is dedicated to maintaining spatially-precise high-resolution representations through the entire network and the complimentary set of parallel branches provide better contextualized features. It also allows information exchange across parallel
streams via selective kernel feature fusion (SKFF) in order to consolidate the highresolution features with the help of low-resolution features, and vice versa.
